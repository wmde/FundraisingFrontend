# This file is meant to be included from the deployment.yml playbook
# It will create an archive of the source code and all its PHP and JavaScript dependencies
#
# The variable "build_dir" contains the inventory-specific path where all the code is checked out and assembled.
# That path could be deleted between deployments, but for performance reasons the code should stay in place.
# "build_dir" is passed in from deployment.yml
#
# All other variables come from the inventory file.
